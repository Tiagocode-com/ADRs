# OPM 1: LADR for decision tracking

Date: 23-06-2024

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to document all the decisions we have made for the project so that we know which decision might be
improved or re-considered in future builds.

## Decision

We will use [Lightweight Architectural Decision Record format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) 
to record the decisions. Additionally, We will store the decisions as code in a git repository to manage,
and access them [Tiagocode.com - ADRs](https://github.com/Tiagocode-com/ADRs/tree/main).

## Consequences

The decision record will become an important part of our system documentation, and it will need to be maintained
when new decisions are made, or old decisions have changed.
