# INF-2: Use GitHub for the repository management

Date: 23-06-2024


## Status

Accepted


## Context

We will need a good service to store/manage our application and infrastructure code in the cloud.


## Decision

We will use GitHub to manage code. It's a popular tool, and offers the GitHub Actions that might be used
for the deployment pipelines.

We also considered the following alternative solutions:

* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) (not selected, because it offers only 30 days freemium account).

* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) (not selected, because it is easier to found information about how 
to build deployment pipelines with GitHub)


## Consequences

No significant consequences.
